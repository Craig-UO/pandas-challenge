# pandas-challenge
This repository is for the Module 4 Challenge using Pandas.

The file PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb was used as a prompt for my script PyCitySchools.ipynb which is in the /PyCitySchools directory.
The script accesses the data source .csv files which are in the /PyCitySchools/Resources directory.
